                The Messenger of Allah said, “Make use of Medicine, for Allah has not made a
                disease without sending a remedy for it, with the exception of one disease,
                namely old age,'' — sunan Abdu Dawood
                Pakistan is ranked outside 100 of 190 countries in terms of overall healthcare
                performance by the WHO (World Health Organization). With a mere of 2% of
                its GDP allocated for total health expenditure, Pakistan struggles to maintain
                a proper healthcare system.
                Numerous weaknesses plague Pakistan's healthcare system such as poor
                governance, outdated facilities, insufficient resources, inadequacy of trained
                staff, unaffordability, inaccessibility, and absence of a modern health
                management system. The doctor to population ratio stands at one doctor to
                every 1500 people, when it should be one for every 1,000. Consequently, fatal
                diseases like dangue and malaria continue to claim human lives, while
                maternal and infant mortality rates are one of the highest in Asia.
                In these circumstances, ITTIHAD TAHAFUZ FOUNDATION tries its best to
                support the existing healthcare system by providing emergency measures as
                well as permanent medical facilities to alleviate the suffering of the common
                man.

                At our charity, our food distribution program stands as a cornerstone of our mission to alleviate hunger
                and nourish our
                community. With dedication and compassion, we work tirelessly to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry.
                Through
                partnerships with local food suppliers and generous donations from supporters, we are able to offer a
                diverse array of
                nutritious food items to individuals and families facing food insecurity. Our distribution centers
                provide a welcoming
                environment where recipients can access fresh produce, pantry staples, and culturally appropriate foods
                with dignity and
                respect. Additionally, our volunteers play a vital role in the success of our program, lending their
                time and energy to
                organize, pack, and distribute meals to those in need. Together, we strive to create a more food-secure
                future for all,

            <div>
                The Messenger of Allah (SAW) was asked, "Which charity is best?" He
                replied, "(Providing) water." - Sunan Abu Dawood
                One of the biggest challenges of our time is the availability of clean drinking
                water. Most areas in KARACHI Pakistan suffer from an acute shortage of
                water, especially in the summer when the situation is made worse by
                prolonged droughts. Even where water is available, there are serious doubts
                about its suitability for human consumption. Only 30% of the population has
                access to drinkable water, while the rest have to manage with contaminated
                water. As a result, waterborne diseases such as diarrhea and Hepatitis B, C
                are common, claiming the lives of tens of thousands of children every year.
                Arsenic poisoning, a direct result of water contamination, is also a major
                hazard, threatening almost 60 million people in the country. Faced with these
                dire statistics, ITTIHAD TAHAFUZ FOUNDATION has taken up the challenge
                of providing safe and clean water to the most vulnerable sections of society,
                both in rural and urban areas. It undertakes initiatives such as installing water
                filtration plants in the urban centers of Karachi, digging water wells in the rural
                areas around Karachi, as well as Thar and Balochistan, and providing a
                variety of pumps wherever needed.
